    <center><h2>The Communists’ Contribution to the Theory and Practice of Indian Politics</h2>
    <h4>E. M. S. Namboodiripad</h4></center>
    <p>It was in the early 1920s that the national revolutionaries of India who had
      come into existence before the First World War were converted into Communists.
      They were influenced by two factors which interacted with each other: Firstly,
      the experience of the struggle inside the National Movement, between
      the Moderate leaders and the Revolutionary ranks which came to the fore just
      before and during the First World War. Secondly, the Russian Proletarian Revolution
      of November 1917 which inspired the Indian revolutionaries as did the revolutionaries
      all over the world. Many of the Indian revolutionaries made almost a pilgrimage to the land
      of the first proletarian revolution in the world. Those who did not undertake such a difficult
      venture formed small communist groups in Bombay, Calcutta, Madras and the U.P.-Punjab region.
    </p>


    <h3 id="section1">CPI formed in Tashkent</h3>
    <p>The Indian emigrate revolutionaries who had gone to several European countries,  to  the  United  States,  Canada  etc.   were  also  influenced  by  the  Russian Revolution. Some of them took the initiative in the Soviet City of Tashkent in organising  what  was  called  the  Communist  Party  of  India. Although  formed outside  India,  this  new  organisation  did  a  lot  of  work  to  educate  the  young Indian communists at home.  That organisation gave the first theoretical and practical education in Marxism-Leninism to the scattered groups of communists living and working in their homeland.  The Tashkent Committee may therefore be considered the original foundation of what subsequently became the Communist Party of India.</p>

    <p>This however had a major drawback although calling itself the Communist Party of India, it had its office outside the country.  For this reason, a section of Indian communists did not consider the formation of the Tashkent group as the  foundation  of  the  Communist  Party  of  India. They  therefore decided to hold an open conference of Indian Communists in the City of Kanpur in U.P.; a legally-working Communist Party of India was also formed in Kanpur.  This, according to some, was the foundation of the real Communist Party of India, since it was formed and functioned inside the country.</p>

    <p>Neither the Tashkent organisation nor its Kanpur successor however could work legally due to intense repression resorted to by the British Rulers. The leading comrades of the Kanpur Communist Party of India, together with a large number of communist fellow travellers, were involved in the Meerut Conspiracy Case which lasted from early 1929 to the end of 1934. Only after the accused in the Meerut Conspiracy Case were released could a formally-constituted, though illegally functioning.  Central Committee and Polit Bureau of the Communist Party of India started working.  The Tashkent Committee and the Kanpur Committee were thus the forerunners of the continuing leadership of the Communist Party of India.</p>

    <p>The work turned out by the Tashkent and the Kanpur Committees, as well as the countrywide organisation of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Party of India(a broader set up than the Kanpur formed Communist Party of India), were thus the organisational foundation in the 1930s for the All India Centre of the Communist Party of India formed in 1934.</p>

    <p>It is thus over six decades since the continuing leadership of the Communist Party of India has been functioning. During the fairly long period, the Party has made enormous strides.  Today, though divided into the CPI(M), the CPI and various other political groups considered Marxist-Leninist, the Communists are a force to reckon with in Indian politics.</p>

    <p>Three of the 25 States - Kerala, West Bengal and Tripura are having governments led by the CPI(M), the CPI and other Marxist groups like the RSP and the Forward Bloc.  At the Centre too, a Government is in existence in which the liberal bourgeois and Marxist-Leninist groups are co-operating with each other with a view to keep the two major bourgeois formations, the Congress (I) and the BJP, out of power.</p>

    <p>Apart from the Centre, this combination is leading also the State Governments of Tamil Nadu, Andhra, Karnataka, Bihar, Assam and Jammu and Kashmir.  Nine out of 25 States in India thus have governments in which Marxist-Leninists are participants. The general political influence of Indian Communists over the Central and State administration is therefore unmistakable.</p>

    <p>Although numerically the Marxist-Leninists are a small minority in the Indian political scene, its influence in Indian politics is far more than the electoral strength wielded by the Indian Marxist-Leninists.  For, unlike other political groups, the Marxist-Leninists have made a distinct contribution to the theory and practice of Indian politics. It is attempted in this article to explain how this influence of Marxism-Leninism on the theory and practice of Indian politics has arisen.</p>

    <br/>


    <h3 id="section2">The great heritage of early ideological work</h3>

   <p>As early as in the beginning of the 1920s, the leaders of the Tashkent group which called itself the Communist Party of India made big contributions to the study of the economy,  polity,  philosophy,  etc.  of India.  In a series of articles written in the periodical journals brought out by the Tashkent group, current major political developments were subjected to Marxist-Leninist analysis.</p>

   <p>M. N. Roy, the former Indian national revolutionary who became a communist, wrote a series of articles in the journal of the Tashkent group, subjecting current political developments in India to Marxist-Leninist analysis. His contributions to the discussion of the communal problem and the analysis of the Mahatma Gandhi phenomenon were greatly rewarding to the Indian Communists.</p>

   <p>His analysis of the communal riots that were breaking out after the withdrawal of the Non-Cooperation-Khilafat Movement constituted a great contribution to the study of a major socio-political problem.  His analysis contained in the book India in Transition was, in fact, the first beginning of Marxist-Leninist analysis of the Economy, Polity and Ideology of India under British Rule.</p>

   <p>Another foreign comrade who did the same work was Rajani Palme Dutt, the  British  Communist  who  wrote Notes  of  the  Month which  were  a  month-by-month  analysis  of  international  developments  as  well  as  national  political developments in India.  His book under the title India Today was a sister publication to Roy’s India in Transition. The two together constituted text books applying Marxist-Leninist theory to the basic socio-economic, cultural and political problems of India.</p>

   <p>Such ideological work carried out by Roy and Dutt together with the day-to-day political and organisational work turned out by the comrades in India, gave an ideological basis on which the finally-organised and centralised Communist Party of India with its Central Committee and Polit Bureau came into being.</p>

   <p>This tradition of ideological work, applying the theory of Marxism-Leninism to  Indian  condition  and  enriching  the  theory  of  Marxism-Leninism  with  the experience  of  the  political-organisational  revolutionary  work  turned  out  by the Marxist-Leninists, was carried forward by Indian communists from 1934-35(when a Central Committee and Polit Bureau came to be formed and were able to work continuously).  This is the great heritage that we of the CPI(M), the CPI and other Marxist-Leninists proudly cherish and carry forward.</p>

   <p>It  is  proposed  in  the  following  paragraphs  to  explain  what  are  the  major contributions  made  by  the  Indian  communists  in  this  long  period,  stretching from  the  formation  of  the  Tashkent  group  which  called  itself  the  Communist Party of India down to the present times</p>

   <p>As  early  as  in  the  beginning  of  the  1920s,  M.  N.  Roy  in  his  writings  haddrawn attention to the problems of communal riots, relating it to class struggle. He pointed out that the only antidote to communal division is class unity which means the bringing together of the working people belonging to all castes and communities in the struggle against imperialism and the rich belonging to all castes and communities. This principle is even relevant today, more than seven decades after Roy wrote his articles. Class unity through struggles against the oppressing classes is the only solution to the communal problem.</p>

   <p>As opposed to the Hindutva, Islamic Republic, Christian rule and so on, as well as to the rule of particular castes should be projected the democratic republic in which men and women born in every caste, believing in every religion andso on should be brought together in the struggle against the exploiting classes cutting across all caste and communal differences among the ruling classes.</p>

   <p>This was the basis on which, two decades later, the communists joined other secular forces including the Congress in opposing the two nation theory of Mohammed Ali Jinnah on which the demand for Pakistan was propagated. The Congress however projected, the communists pointed out, their idea of a single nation State of India; they rejected the idea that India is inhabited by crores of people  who  are  divided  on  the  basis  of  language  and  culture  and  that  the area inhabited by a single linguistic-cultural group is a nationality  within  the greater unity of the Indian Nation.  We on our part pointed out that the political unity of India can be preserved only if the linguistic cultural groups inhabiting a particular State is considered a distinct nationality within the indivisible Indian State.  It was in this sense that the communists in the 1940s called India a multi-national State.  Multinational India defined by the communists is, in other words, supplementary rather than contradictory to the unity of India as a nation.</p>

   <p>That  was  why  the  Programme  of  the  united  Communist  Party  of  India adopted in 1951 and the Programme of the CPI(M) and the CPI adopted in 1964 demanded maximum possible State autonomy for every cultural-linguistic group like the Malayalees, the Bengalis, the Tamils, the Andhras, the Kannadigas, the Punjabis etc.</p>

   <p>This was the distinct contribution made by the Indian communists to the nature  and  content  of  Indian  politics. India’s  unbreakable  unity  can  be  safe-guarded  only  if  the  multiplicity  of  linguistically-culturally  defined  States  are considered distinct nationalities within the united Indian State.  No other political party has been able to put forward such a clear idea.  This therefore is avaluable contribution made by the Marxists-Leninists to the theory and practice of India’s political thought.</p>

<br/>

   <h3 id="section3">Agrarian  Revolution - Before  and  After  Independence</h3>

   <p>The first Programmatic statement of the illegal Communist Party of India issued in 1930 drew attention to the inter-relationship between the National Revolution  and  the  Agrarian  Revolution. Indian  freedom  can  be  won  only  through the revolutionary means in which the multi-million peasantry are drawn into a militant movement headed by the working class.</p>

   <p>This was opposed to the ideas of the bourgeois leadership of the national movement led by Mahatma Gandhi, such as non-violence, the landlord-bourgeois classes being “trustees” of the people for their property etc.  The Communist Party of India therefore was enjoined to carry on an ideological struggle against these Gandhian concepts, as well as socio-political struggles by way of organisingthe industrial and agricultural workers, working peasants and all other sectionsof the working people against bourgeois-landlord oppression.  This was the dividing  line  between  the  bourgeois-sponsored  right  leadership  of  the  Congress and the mass of Congressmen and women.</p>

   <p>Within the Congress organisation, a clear left group emerged in the mid-1930s. Its struggle against the right leadership reached its climax in the electionto the Congress Presidentship in 1939.  The left candidate fighting that election, Subhash Chandra Bose, issued a statement in which he alleged that the right-wing leadership of the Congress was trying to enter into negotiations with the British Rulers on transfer of power to India. This, he said, is contrary to the national interests.  What is required is mass national struggle against British Imperialism for which policy he was fighting the election.</p>

   <p>The line advocated by the left candidate in the Congress Presidential election had the support of a majority of ordinary Congressmen. Bose therefore waselected President of the Congress.  The bourgeois leadership however manoeuvred him out of the Congress Presidentship, going to the extent of personally expelling him from the Congress. This was the background against which two forms of anti-imperialist struggle  were  organised  in  the  1940s  -  the  Quit  India struggle led by the Congress headed by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Army movement led by Subhash Chandra Bose.  The former was apparently a militant struggle which drew millions of Indians into militant forms of  action. The latter resulted  in  the  formation  of  the Indian National  Army headed by Subhash Chandra Bose which had an agreement with the military Rulers of Japan who extended support to the I. N. A.</p>

   <p>The Communist Party of India could not support either of them because the Quit India struggle organised by the Congress leadership was the preparation for a move to put pressure on the British Rulers to open negotiations with the bourgeois leaders for transfer of power.  As for the INA, the Communist Party of India considered that, despite the genuinely anti-imperialist sentiments of its leaders, it was a movement directed by the Japanese imperialist power which had its contradictions with the British Rulers.</p>

   <p>The Communist Party of India therefore kept away from both the movements but, after the end of the war, it engaged itself in mighty militant mass struggles like the strike wave of the industrial workers and militant peasant movements like the Tebhaga movement in Bengal, the Punnapra Vayalar struggle in Travancore, the Telengana struggle in Hyderabad and peasant outbreaks in various parts of the country like the Telegu districts and Malabar in Madras, the district of Thane in Maharashtra, several districts in Punjab and so on. Together with the strike wave of industrial workers, middle class employees including government employees, students, youths, women etc.  this was a mighty revolutionary upsurge in the post-war months.  Despite its isolation from the anti-imperialistmasses because of its opposition to Quit India and INA movements therefore, the Communist Party of India came out as the leader of revolutionary movements in the post-war years.</p>

   <p>However, the Communist Party of India was an extremely weak force in the anti-imperialist movement  which by  and large  was led  by  the  Congress.  Thelatter therefore used the enormous prestige which it enjoyed thanks to its leadership of the Quit India and INA movements, to direct the immense mass upsurges the basis on which negotiations could be opened between the Congress and the  Government  as  well  as  between  the  Congress  and  the  League. These way-negotiations ultimately enabled the British rulers to put into practice the slogan given by the Muslim League to “divide and quit” India. The negotiations ended in the transfer of power to the Congress leaders in the Hindu-majority Indian Union and to the League leaders in the Muslim majority Pakistan. The militant  mass  actions,  to  some  of  which  the  Communist  Party  of  India  gave effective leadership like the Telengana struggle which lasted for 4 years and the Bombay revolt of the personnel of the Royal Indian Navy, were thus betrayed by the bourgeoisie because the proletariat and its party had not become powerful enough to develop the militant mass struggles into a revolutionary all-India upheaval.</p>

<br/>

   <h3 id="section4">Nationalism and Internationalism</h3>

   <p>The Congress which led the Quit India struggle and the Subhash Chandra Bose leadership which gave leadership to the INA movement were two forms in which the bourgeois leadership tried to use the situation created by the Second World War for throwing the British out. The Congress leaders, used the Quit India struggle  to  initiate  negotiations  with  the  British  Rulers, while the Subhash Chandra Bose leadership depended upon the anti-British faction of imperialist powers for winning freedom. Both were sincere in their desire to win freedom for India–the Congress leadership through negotiations with the British Rulers and the Bose leadership through direct military and financial assistance from the fascist powers to throw the British out of India. Both however were contrary to the interests of the Indian people who wanted to carry out an anti-imperialist and  anti-feudal  agrarian  revolution. The  CPI’s  opposition  to  the  Quit  India and INA movements therefore was, in the last analysis, correct. However, the CPI was a minor force in the political scenario, unable to meet the onslaught of Gandhian ideology in the Quit India movement and the left bourgeois, pro-fascist ideology of the INA movement.</p>

   <p>The same difficulty had been faced during the years of the anti-fascist war by our comrades in several foreign countries, particularly in China,  Vietnam, Laos  and  Cambodia  as  well  as  Korea. They  too  had  to  face  the  ideological and political offensive of the bourgeoisie. But, unlike us in India, they were far stronger, far more powerful in their respective national movements. They could organise a wide national revolutionary movement which was anti-fascist as well as  directed  against the ruling imperialist power in  their  respective  countries. They  therefore  could  come  out  of  the  war  period  much  stronger  than  we  in India.</p>

   <p>The  Chinese comrades could throw the Kuomintang, reactionaries out of power, making China People’s Democratic Republic. In Vietnam too, at the end of the war, half of the country was liberated where a People's Democratic Government headed by Ho Chi Minh was established. The same thing happened in Korea where the Communists could establish themselves as the ruling party in the northern part of the country, while the south remained under the leadership of the reactionary bourgeoisie. That was how the end of the anti-fascist war saw India divided on communal lines, while China, North Vietnam and North Korea had People’s Democratic Revolutions.</p>

   <p>China,  Vietnam  and  Korea  were  thus  examples  of  the  successful  carrying out of the programme of anti-imperialist agrarian revolution, while in India the process of agrarian revolution was disrupted by the manoeuvres reported to by the British Rulers, together with the two (the Congress and the League) wings of the Indian bourgeois leadership.</p>

   <p>It  however  goes  to  the  credit  of  the  CPI  that,  during  the  two  bourgeois-led  movements  of  the  Quit  India  and  the  INA,  the  Party  could  successfully steer clear of bourgeois ideologies and keep the flag of proletarian internationalism afloat. The Party stuck to the principle of proletarian internationalism, declaring that the anti-fascist war waged by the Soviet Union, China, Vietnam and Korea was as much a People’s War for India as it was for those particular countries.</p>

   <p>However, because of the organisational weakness of the CPI, the Congress and the League leadership could come to a negotiated settlement with the British Rulers  for  transfer  of  power  to  the  Congress  in  the  Indian  Union  and  to  the Muslim  League  in  Pakistan. But  the  very  role  played  by  the  CPI  in  leadingthe post-war revolutionary upsurge made the party a significant force in Indian politics.</p>

   <p>The result was that, in the first general elections which took place in 1952, the party came out as the major party of opposition both in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. The roles played by A.K.G. in the Lok Sabha and Sundarayyain the Rajya Sabha, together with the work of the Communist and allied groups in Travancore-Cochin, Madras, Hyderabad, West Bengal and Tripura enabled the Party to become a force to reckon within Indian politics, although, in electoral terms on the national scale it was a small minority.</p>

   <p>Mention may, in this context, be made also to the role played by the then left in the united CPI on the question of India-China dispute in 1959-1962.  As in the days of the Quit India and INA movements, in the days of the India-China dispute too, the CPI as a whole, particularly the left in the CPI, was relatively isolated among the anti-imperialist masses. The stand adopted by the left in the CPI however made it clear that, as opposed to the line of war with China adopted by all the bourgeois parties and the right wing in the CPI, the left in the CPI advocated peaceful negotiations for settlement of the India-China dispute which was proved correct in subsequent years when the Government of India itself had practically to admit that it was foolish on its part to have gone to war with China on the border question. Not only the then right in the CPI but even such  parties  as  the  Congress  and  the  subsequent BJP had  to  admit that the border dispute between India and China has to be settled through negotiations with China and not through war.</p>

   <p>The three decades that elapsed since the beginning of the organised work of the CPI’s leadership in 1934 to the split of the party in 1964 was thus the period  in  which  the  united  CPI  made  big  advances  but  during  which  serious differences arose within the CPI — between the right and the left wings in the Party.</p>

<br/>

   <h3 id="section5"> Right and "Left" Opportunism in the Pre-split CPI</h3>

   <p>Although it witnessed big advances made by the Party from 1934 to 1964, its leadership  was  a  victim  of  right  and  “left”  opportunism.   In  the  1942-1946 period,  the  Party  leadership  was  the  victim  of  right  opportunism.   This  was corrected at the Second Congress of the Party held in 1948, but the leadership switched over from right to “left” opportunism.</p>

   <p>The left opportunism which made its first appearance at the Second Congress of the Party, repeated itself in a new form at the 1950 May meeting of the Central Committee. Both  however  were  corrected,  after  serious  discussions  with  the leadership of the CPSU, at a Special Conference held in October 1951.</p>

   <p>The  common  mistake  of  the  right  and  “left”  opportunism  was  the  failure to realise that, if the programme of carrying out the anti-imperialist agrarian revolution  is  to  be  implemented,  the  Party  has  to  base  itself  on  the  militant struggles  of  the  working  people  led  by  the  working  class,  combined  with  the tactics  of  revolutionary  use  of  elections  and  legislatures  under  the  bourgeois constitution.   Out  of  this  common  failure  arose  the  two  deviations  of  (a)  thebourgeois right opportunism and (b) the petty bourgeois “left” opportunism. These were subjected to serious self-criticism which ended in the formulation of a new Party Programme and Statement of Policy.</p>

   <p>The  Programme  stated  that  the  immediate  objective  of  the  Communist Party  of  India  is  not  the  introduction  of  socialism  in  India  which  is  impracticable since the objective conditions are lacking and the necessary subjective forces are not developed.  The Programme however pointed out that the crisis of  the  system  in  the  post  independence  period  had  brought  to  the  forefront the possibility of bringing about a people’s democratic revolution out of which will  arise  a  people’s  democratic  State  and  Government.   It  was  on  this  basis that a Programme of people’s democracy was adopted at the Calcutta special conference of the party in October 1951.</p>

   <p>Having  thus  spelt  out  the  objective  of  the  people’s  democratic  revolution which was incorporated in the Party Programme, the Statement of Policy discussed  the  tactical  line.   Considering  the  current  objective  situation  and  the maturity of the development of the subjective forces, the Statement of Policy, adopted along with the Party Programme, made two points:</p>

   <p>Firstly, post-independence India having established a bourgeois democratic system with its elected legislatures to which the executives are responsible, it is necessary for the Party to go into the electoral battle, secure as many electoral victories as possible since all electoral battles are the concrete manifestations of class struggle.</p>

   <p>Secondly, struggle on the parliamentary arena is only an important aspect of  the  struggle  for  People’s  Democracy. As  important  as  the  struggle  on  the electoral arena is the struggles of the working people outside the parliamentary arena.  Any neglect of the struggle on the parliamentary arena will no doubt amount to failure to use the immense possibilities of gathering the revolutionary forces under the leadership of the working class.</p>

   <p>There should however be no illusion, spread by the right wing Social Democrats, that merely through the struggles on the parliamentary arena, the struggle for people’s  democracy  will  end  in  success.   On  the  other  hand,  the  very  use  of bourgeois parliament for preparing people’s democracy should be subordinated to the extra parliamentary struggle. Non-use of the revolutionary potentialities of the struggle on the parliamentary arena and subordinating the mass struggle to  parliamentary  work  are  the  “left”  and  right  forms  of  opportunism  against which the Party should guard itself.</p>

   <p>The  Statement  of  Policy,  adopted  along  with  the  Party  Programme,  had visualised  a  situation  where  the  Party  will  have  to  adopt  the  tactics  of  waging peasant guerilla war as was done in Telengana.  Actual experience however proved that, if the bourgeoisie resorted to the method of sabotage against People’s Democracy, that situation has to be faced by mobilising more and more masses of working people led by the working class against the bourgeois-landlord Government.</p>

   <p>That was why the Party did not have any hesitation to form its own government in Kerala in 1957 and use that opportunity to mobilise the people around the programme of agrarian reforms and other measures which would bring more and more people to the cause of People’s Democracy.</p>

   <p>The  major  contribution  made  by  the  pre-split  CPI  in  the  1950s  was  the successful use of the parliamentary arena-membership of the two houses of parliament  at  the  Centre  and  State  legislature  everywhere  as  well  as  the  Kerala Government without slipping into the right opportunist “Parliamentarism” of the social democratic type.</p>

   <p>The left-wing in the pre-split CPI which converted itself into the CPI(M) made a concrete analysis of the rise and overthrow of the Kerala Government on the basis of which the newly emerging CPI(M) wrote pargraph 112 in the 1964 Programme. While  drawing  attention  to  the  possibilities  of  forming  left-led governments in various States, that paragraph warned against the illusion that the governments formed on that basis would be able to solve the basic problems either of the country as a whole or of the State concerned.</p>

   <p>It was on the basis of this understanding, further strengthened by the formation of two left-led governments (Kerala and West Bengal) in 1967 that the CPI(M) formulated the idea that the left-led governments should be considered as "instruments of struggle for winning more and more popular masses, more and more political allies, to the cause of People’s Democracy".</p>

   <p>One consequence of this understanding of the relation between the parliamentary and extra-parliamentary struggles was the fact the CPl(M) came to the conclusion that, while it should take initiative to form and lead its own State Governments wherever possible, it would not join governments unless the Party is sure that it can influence the policies of the Governments.</p>

   <p>That was why, in 1967, the non-left governments in Punjab, U.P. and Bihar were supported by the Party, though it did not join them. The same policy was adopted by the CPl(M) in relation to the Janata Government in 1977, the National Front Government in 1989 and, finally, the United Front Government in 1996.</p>

<br/>

  <h3 id="section6"> In the Post-split CPI and the CPl(M)</h3>

  <p>The Struggle between the  right  and  the  left  in  the  pre-split  CPI  ultimately led to the 1964 split.  This was based on 3 ideological-political issues and one organisational issue.  The ideological political issues were:</p>

  <p>(a) The attitude to the Congress and its Government: The right in the pre-split  CPI  and  the post-split  CPI  looked  upon the  Congress  as  a  “progressive national organisation”  with  which  the  Communists  should  collaborate. TheCPl(M),  on  the  other  hand,  stood  for  uncompromising  struggle  against  the Congress, even though, from issue to issue, the Party was prepared to cooperate with the Congress.  (At the Fourth Congress of the pre-split CPI, the right in the Party had called for such unity with the Congress as would eventually lead to the formation of a Congress-Communist coalition government.)  Defeated at that  particular  Party  Congress,  they  did,  after  the  split,  implement  the  line in  practice  in  Kerala  and  West  Bengal:   the  CPI  leader  in  Kerala  (Achutha Menon) headed the anti CPI(M) Government of which the Home Minister was the notorious Karunakaran; in West Bengal too, the post-split CPI extended full cooperation to the semi-fascist terror regime of the early 1970s and subsequently to Indira Gandhi’s Emergency regime.</p>

  <p>(b)  On  the  India-China  border  dispute,  the  post-split  CPI  extended  full support to the campaign for the anti-China War. The CPl(M) on the other hand, fought for the Government of India entering into negotiations with China and settling the border question through talks.  The post-split CPI joined not only the Congress but even the Jan Sangh in carrying on a chauvinistic campaign against the Chinese and against the so-called “pro-China” CPI(M). It was from this campaign that the bourgeois politicians and the bourgeois media took courage to characterise the CPI(M) as “pro-China” and the post-split CPI as“Pro-Russia”.</p>

  <p>(c) On question of ideological dispute between the Soviet Party on the one hand and Chinese Party on the other, the CPI fully sided with the Soviet position, while the CPI(M) opposed the Soviet line, even while entertaining reser-vations on some aspects of the Chinese line.</p>

  <p>Together with these major ideological and political issues was the question of inner-party unity on which too pre-split CPI was sharply divided.  The left in the pre-split CPI demanded that all ideological and political questions in dispute between the two sides should be discussed at a special party conference convened on the basis of party membership existing at the previous party Congress.  This was not acceptable to the right in the pre-split CPI. Based on this accidental majority of members of the leading bodies of the pre-split CPI, they demanded that their political and organisational position should be accepted by the entire party.  The accidental majority enjoyed by them in the leading bodies of the pre-split CPI emboldened them to start taking disciplinary actions against those who differed from them.  All the appeals made by the left in the pre-split CPI for  finding  democratic  solutions  to  the  political  and  organisational  problems were rejected.  The left in the pre-split CPI therefore were forced to organise themselves  separately,  forming  a  new  separate  party  called  the  CPI(M). </p>

  <p>The ideological, political and organisational struggle between the post-split CPI and the CPI(M) was thus a continuation of the struggle that went on in the pre-split CPI. Considering the fact that, on all the 3 issues on which the right and the left  fought  each  other  in  the  pre-split  CPl-approach  to  the  Congress  and  its Government, the India-China border dispute and the crisis in the international communist  movement-subsequent  history  has  proved  that  the  post-split  CPI had adopted a wrong line while the CPI (M) had a correct line.  Any attempt at re-unification of the communist movement should therefore begin with a serious self-criticism on the part of the post-split CPI.</p>

  <p>Before closing this subject, it is necessary to note that the CPI(M) had to fight and defeat the "left" and right opportunism which raised its head in the Party, as for example:</p>

  <p>(a) There was a trend in the Party leadership in the 1970s that, in view of the semi-fascist terror in West Bengal and the Emergency regime at the national level, the Party should organise itself for a Telengana type struggle;</p>
  <p>(b) This found expression at the 10th Congress (Jalandhar) where a minority of delegates opposed the line of supporting the Janata Government;</p>
  <p>(c) There was a strong opposition at the Salkia Plenum for the proposition that  the  Party  should  develop  itself  as  a  "a  mass  revolutionary  party  of  the working class”.  The argument was that a revolutionary party can never be a mass party.</p>
  <p>(d) When the Party decided to break with the Janata Government for its links with the RSS, there was opposition to it from a minority.</p>
  <p>(e) On the eve of the formation of the United Front, a view was expressed in the PB and CC that we should join the government, even leading it.</p>
  <p>It  is  thus  obvious  that  the  post-split  CPIM)  has  to  fight  and  defeat  the manifestations of “left” and “right” opportunism.  The post-split CPI, Naxalites and  other  groups  that  consider  themselves  communist  will  therefore  have  to undertake a serious self-criticism of their ideology, politics and organisation.</p>

<h3 id="section7"> Re-Unification  of  Ideology  and  Politics  before  Organisational Re-Unification</h3>
<p>Three decades after the formal coming into existence of a regularly functioning CPI, the party got divided into the CPI(M) and CPI; from within the CPI(M)itself,  the  Naxalites  and  other  "Left  Communists"  also  came  into  existence. Furthermore, certain other left parties like the Forward Bloc and the RSP are today in the field.</p>
<p>After a decade and a half of the separate existence of the CPI(M) and the CPI,  they  started  working  together  in  struggle  against  the  Congress  on  the one  hand  and  certain  other  bourgeois  parties  (including  caste  and  communal parties)  on  the  other.   These  united  actions  gradually  developed  into  a  more stable united front of left parties which allied itself with certain other secular democratic parties.</p>
<p>That was how the two Left Front Governments of West Bengal and Tripura as well as the Left Democratic Front Government in Kerala have come into existence.  The constituents of these left and democratic fronts have come together also at the national level to form the United Front Government.</p>
<p>This United Front Government at the Centre and the left coalition governments in the 3 States have raised the question whether the time has not come for all parties and organisations which consider themselves Marxist-Leninists to merge themselves in a single party.  It was the CPI which raised this question first.  But the sentiment has spread in other left parties as well.</p>
<p>The CPI(M) however considers it impractical and undesirable at present to have a single united Communist Party of India.  The organisational coming together of various Marxist-Leninist groups should in its view follow, not precede, the unification of an ideological and political character.</p>
<p>Unless the question of why the pre-split CPI was divided into the CPI(M) and  the  CPI  and  why  other  left  groups  calling  themselves  Marxist-Leninists have  come  into  existence  is  addressed  properly  and  answers  given,  it  will  be ridiculous to think of organisational unification of all existing Marxist-Leninist groups.  That is why the CPI(M) suggests:</p>
<p>(a) Unity in action to develop the emerging unity of left, secular and democratic forces;</p>
<p>(b) Continue with fraternal discussions of the ideological and political questions which divide various groups with a view to arriving at a common understanding on the international, national,  political and organisational questions. As  pointed  out  by  Lenin,  ideological  and  political  unity  is  an  essential  pre-condition for organisational unity.</p>
<p>The emergence of a united movement of left, democratic secular and federalist forces is a great achievement of the more than 7 decades of the existence of India’s Marxist-Leninists.  In the course of this work of 7 decades, while the Indian  communists  have  made  tremendous  advances,  they  have  also  committed some serious mistakes.  These should be subjected to serious self-criticism(by all Marxist-Leninist groups) with a view to consolidate achievements and correct  the  mistakes.   Only  such  a  self-criticism,  undertaken  by  all  Marxist-Leninist groups, would prepare the ground for the organisational unification of all communist parties and groups into one single united Marxist-Leninist Party in India. While the time has come for us to keep that objective, it is pre-mature to give the slogan of a merger of all Marxist-Leninist groups. The essential pre-condition for the subsequent re-unification or merger of all Marxist-Leninist groups is the development of the emerging unity in action among all left groups on the basis of  a  critical  and  self-critical  analysis  of  the  7  decades  of  the  development  of India’s Marxist-Leninist movement.</p>
