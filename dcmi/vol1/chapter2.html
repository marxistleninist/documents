    <center><h2>Early Contacts of the Indian Revolutionaries with the Leaders of October Revolution</h2></center>

    <h3 id="sectionA">A. Indian Revolutionaries in Moscow <a href="#2.1" id="r2.1">*</a></h3>
    <p>On the eve of my departure from Tashkent, Abani Mukherjee arrived from
Moscow. I had no news of his coming. He had no business there. I had sent
him to the Baku Congress on the understanding that, on return to Moscow,
he would leave for Western Europe to take up his headquarters in Holland
with the object of establishing contact with India through the intermediacy of
sailors. So his sudden arrival was not only a surprise, but it also turned out to
be an embarrassment. He readily volunteered to take over charge of the Military School during my absence. He was also an ardent advocate of developing
the Communist Party of India and increasing its membership. Because of his
previous record with the Tcheka, Peter came to know of his arrival instantly.
He had never got over the disappointment of having had to let him go out of his
bloody clutches owing to my intervention, backed up by Lenin’s benevolence.
Given his ambitious and stormy character, Abani Mukherjee was sure to get
into some trouble before long. Who would protect him this time against Peter’s
vengeance? Safarov disliked him heartily. Before leaving, I saw Peter to plead
with him to be more lenient. He growled at me : Why did I bring Mukherjee
here? He was sure to create trouble, and in that case Peter would take him
without fail. The meaning of Peter taking anybody was quite unequivocal. I
was frightened and told him that Mukherjee had promised to behave properly
and there were a dozen intelligent Indian revolutionaries who would keep a check
on him. I was surprised that Mukherjee had left Moscow just before the Third
World Congress, and that he willingly agreed to stay away. I came to know the
reason as soon as I returned to Moscow.
      </p>

      <p>When I reached there, several Indian revolutionaries had arrived from Berlin as representatives of the defunct Indian Revolutionary Committee.  On my way to Moscow, I had pleaded with the leading Indian revolutionaries in Berlin to proceed to Russia, which at that time offered them the only safe asylum and promised  to  be  a  reliable  base  for  work  to  promote  revolution  in  India.   At that  time,  they  did  not  seem  to  believe  that  the  Russian  Revolution  would last;  and  Communism  did  not  find  favour  with  them.   So,  when  at  last  they changed  their  mind  and  turned  towards  the  base  of  world  revolution,  I  was naturally very glad.  But to my great surprise,  the few representatives of the Berlin Revolutionary Committee who had already reached Moscow were rather cool in their response to my friendly attitude. However, I learned from them that they had come only as a vanguard of the Revolutionary Committee, which would before long reach Moscow in full force.  I hoped that on the arrival of veteran revolutionaries like Virendranath Chattopadhyaya, Bhupendranath Dutta and others, the relation would change.  I eagerly looked out for the arrival of men who with their revolutionary devotion and long experience could be expected to be good comrades and willing collaborators.</p>

      <p>Within  a  short  time,  they  all  arrived  to  announce  that  the  Indian Revolutionary  Committee  of  Berlin,  which  alone  had  the authority  to speak  in  behalf  of  India,  had  decided  to  shift  its  headquarters  to Moscow,   if   favourable   conditions   were   offered.   Although   the declaration insinuated that I had no right to speak in behalf of India, I made no secret that the plan of the Indian revolutionaries shifting their headquarters  to  Moscow  would  have  my  fullest  support;  and  there could  be  no  doubt  that  nowhere  in  the  world  could  better  conditions be  obtained  than  in  Moscow.  But  curiously  enough,  the  newcomers not  only  tried  to  avoid  me,  but  some  of  them  actually  took  up  an openly hostile attitude.</p>

      <p>The Indian Revolutionary Committee of Berlin was then a thing of the past. Irrespective of whatever might have been its achievements in the earlier days, during the closing years of  the  war  it  was  a  divided  house  and  had  practically  disintegrated. Instead of working on the authority of that legend, it would have been wiser  to  have  made  a  new  beginning  under  different  circumstances. But  it  seems  that  the  news  of  the  formation  of  the  emigrant  Indian Communist  Party  at  Tashkent   had   frightened  the  old   nationalist revolutionaries,  who  regarded  the  new  body  as  a  challenge  to  their authority.  If  I  had  had  the  opportunity  to  meet  the  leaders  of  the delegation  from  Berlin,  I  could  have  explained  the  situation  to  their satisfaction.  I  did  not  approve  of  the  formation  of  the  emigrant Communist  Party,  and  I  did  not  believe  that  it  had  any  right  to speak on behalf of the workers of India, not to mention the Indian people as a whole. </p>

      <p>The delegation of Indian revolutionaries from Berlin was composed of fourteen people, including Virendranath Chatto-padhyaya, Bhupendranath  Dutta,  Virendranath  Das  Gupta,  the  Maharashtrian Knankhoje,  Gulam  Ambia  Khan  Luhani,  Nalini  Gupta.  The  driving force of the delegation however was Agnes Smedley, an American by birth.  I  had  met  her  in  America.  Then  she  was  an  anarchist-pacifist. Working  as  private  Secretary  of  Lajpatrai  for  some  time,  she  seemed to  have  developed  a  great  sympathy  for  India.  Having  learned  that famous Indian revolutionaries were living  in  Berlin, at the conclusion of the War she came  over  there and became a  very active  member of the Indian group.</p>

      <p>But  the  delegation  which  came  to  Moscow  was  evidently  not the original  Indian  Revolutionary  Committee  of  Berlin.  Hardayal  and Chattopadhyaya  had  been  the.two  dominant  figures  of  the  Berlin Committee and as such they had clashed before long. No less ardently anti-British,  Hardayal  however  was  taken  prisoner  in  Germany  and detained   on   the   suspicion   of   enemy   espionage.   When   Germany surrendered, he escaped to Stockholm and wrote a book describing hisexperiences  in  Germany.  Evidently,  the  experience  had  embittered him.  He  appeared  to  be  an  apologist  of  the  British  rule  in  India  and advocated  Dominion  Status  as  against  complete  independence  He actually wrote something which, though true, ought not to be said by a revolutionary  Indian  nationalist. Pointing out the  fact that the  fighters for Indian freedom had  learned  their  political  lesson  from  Britain,  Hardayal  made  the declaration that, if India was the mother, Britain was the grandmother. That  naturally  scandalised  all  Indian  nationalists.  It was  alleged  that he  had  written  the  book  with  the  object  of  getting  the  permission  to return  to  Britain  and  subsequently  to  India.  But  evidently he  did  not get the permission.  He stayed on  in Sweden and during the  last  years of  his  life  taught  Indian  philosophy  in  the  old  University  of Upsala. That  was  a  recognition  of  his  learning  and  intellectual  calibre.  The chairman  of  the  Berlin  Committee,  Mohammad  Hasan  Mansoor,  had gone to Turkey in the earlier years of the War. He returned from there to  Berlin  disillusioned  and  disgruntled  and  declared  himself  to  be  a Communist.  The  professed  conversion  to  communism  isolated  himfrom  the  old  colleagues.  He  did  not  join  them  when  they came  to Moscow, but  later on came there alone and  lived  quietly  for a couple of years. I have already referred to  my experience with him. When in 1919  I  reached  Berlin,  Bhupendranalh  Dutta  was  the  only  original member of the war-time Indian Revolutionary Commitee living there. All  the  others  had  dispersed.  Virendranath  Chattopadhyaya himself had  gone  to  Stockholm  to  plead  the  case  of  India's  independence  in the International Socialist Conference there. </p>

      <p>Feeling  that  the  Indian  revolutionaries  from  Berlin  were  not  very kindly  disposed  towards  me,  I  left  them  alone  so  as  to  obviate  the impression  that  I  was  trying  to  influence  them  or  to  stand  in the  way of  whatever  plan  they  might  have  had.  But  I  could  not  help being puzzled and pained when most of them would not even speak to me. It seemed  they  had  the  entirely  groundless  misgiving  that  I  might  stand in  their  way  to  seeing  various  Russian  leaders  and  plead  their  case. Curiously  enough,  they  were  very  eager  to  see  Chicherin  in  the  first place.  He  was  still  Commissar  of  Foreign  Affairs,  but  wielded  no great  political  influence.  Moreover,  he  had  just  received  the  British note about  the activities of Indian revolutionaries  in Central  Asia and naturally  did  not  think  that  it  would  be  very  wise  to  receive  well-known  Indian  revolutionaries.  in  Moscow.  Nevertheless,  as  a  polite man,  not  willing  to  offend  anybody's  feelings,  he  did  have  a  short meeting with a few of the Indian revolutionaries. It seems the latter were disappointed with  the  meeting.  Then  they  demanded  an  interview  with  Lenin himself.  They  made  a  great  secret  of  the   move,  most  probably believing  that  I  might  stand  in  their  way.  But  I  got  the  news  from Lenin  himself.  He  telephoned  to  me  and  asked  me  to  come  and  see him.  He  enquired  about  the  Indian  revolutionaries  who  had come  to Moscow, and if it was necessary for him to see them. If they had come to  discuss  any  plan  of  revolutionary  work  in  India,  they  should address   themselves   to   the   Communist   International.   Lenin   was surprised  to  hear  that  the  Indian  revolutionaries  were  not  at  all  well disposed  towards  me.  Nevertheless,  I  suggested  that  he  should  see them  and  hear  what  they  had  to  say.  Lenin  remarked  that  I  was  in  a minority of one against  fourteen. I replied  that  he knew that I  did  not claim to represent anybody but myself. So, as far as I was concerned, there  was  no  conflict  between  the  Indian  revolutionaries and  myself. Lenin   enquired   if   I   had   discussed   matters   with   them,   and was surprised  to  hear  that  they  would  not  even  speak  to  me.  Evidently in exasperation  he  sat  back  in  his  chair  and  said:  “Well,  select  three  of them  to  come  and  see  me.”  I  told  him  that  I  could  not  do  that,  he would have to contact them directly. </p>

      <p>In  the  next  days  there  was  a  great  flutter  hi  the  Indian  delegation. Lenin  had  agreed  to  grant  an  interview.  The  Indian  revolutionaries had   been   informed   that   Lenin   would   receive   three   of   their representatives  chosen  by  themselves.  There  were  differences  as regards the choice. Everybody considered  himself to be  more entitled to  the  honour  and  privilege  than  the  others.  I  could  get  all  this information through Nalini Gupta, the only one who did not share the general  hostile  attitude  towards  me.  He  was  also  the  only one  among the Indian revolutionaries in Europe who maintained some connection with  the  revolutionary  organisations  in  India  by  frequently  travelling back  and  forth  secretly.  He  had  met  some  of  my  friends  in  India  and learned from them about the mission with which J had gone abroad in the beginning of the War. During  his  last  visit to  India shortly before he  came  to  Moscow,  he  was  instructed  to  contact  me.  So  from  the very   beginning   ray   relation   with   him   was   of   mutual   trust   and confidence. </p>

      <p>He   gave   me   the   information   that,   although   among   the   Indian revolutionaries  there  was  a  dispute  about  the  selection  of  the  three  to see Lenin, there was a general agreement about the case which was to be presented on that occasion. A long thesis was being prepared under the  guidance  of  Chatto-padhyaya  and  Agnes  Smedley  to  contradict my  thesis  adopted  by  the  Second  World  Congress  of  the  Communist International  the  year  before.  Luhani,  a  North-Bengal  Muslim,  who had   come   to   Britain   to   study   law,   was   a   clever   man   and an accomplished speaker. But not being one of the senior members of the Berlin  group,  he  was  not  chosen  as  one  of  the  representatives  to  see Lenin. The thesis to be presented by the representatives, however, was drafted by him. The others could not prepare a well argued document. </p>

      <p>Agnes  Smedley,  backed  by  Chattopadhyaya,  wanted  to  be  one  of  the representatives to see Lenin. Her claim was opposed by all the rest of the  Indians.  Finally,  Chatto  and  Dutta,  as  the  seniormost  members, were  chosen  by  general  consent.  I  have  forgotten  who  was  the  third one;  most probably  it was Knankhoje, who was chosen to obviate the allegation that the delegation was purely Bengali. </p>

      <p>Having  given  them  a  polite  and  patient  hearing,  Lenin  advised  the representatives of the Indian revolutionaries to see the Secretary of the Communist  International,  and  remarked  that  the  Soviet  Government could  not  actively  take  part  in  any  plan  for  promoting  revolution  in other  countries.  The  Indian  revolutionary  representatives  returned from  the  coveted  interview  thoroughly  disappointed  and  even  angry. Dutta  blurted  out  that  Indian  revolutionaries  could  expect no  help from  the  Bolsheviks  because  they  were  eager  to  make  peace  with British Imperialism. </p>

      <p>However,  they  saw  Radek,  who  was  then  General  Secretary  of  the Communist  International.  When  they  came  to  his  office,  I was  in another  room  in  the  same  building.  In  their  presence  Radek  spoke  to me  on  telephone.  I  begged  to  be  excused  with  the  remark  that  he would presently learn why I could not come. Lenin had passed on the thesis  submitted  by  the  Indian  revolutionaries  to  Radek.  He  informed his visitors that in its activities to help the national movements in colonies, the Communist International was bound by  the thesis of the Second  World  Congress.  But,  he  added,  if  the  new  Indian  comrades disagreed with  that thesis and wanted the  Communist  International  to alter  its  attitude  and  policy,  they  would  have  an  opportunity  in  the near  future,  when  the  Third  World  Congress  would  meet;  the  Indian revolutionaries  could  stay  on  and  attend  the  World  Congress,  not  of course  as  delegates  with  votes,  but  as  visitors.  But  if  they  submitted their  thesis,  the  Secretariat  of  the  Communist  International  would recommend its consideration by the World Congress.</p>

      <p>The Indian revolutionaries were impatient. They would not waste time in Moscow. They were eager to return to active work which had been interrupted  after  the  War.  They  had  come  to  Moscow  expecting  toreceive  help  so  that  they  could  go  back  to  West  Europe  and  resume revolutionary  activities.  Radek  informed  the  Indian  revolutionaries that  the  Second  Congress  of  the  Communist  International  had  set  up its Central  Asiatic  Bureau as the  instrument to promote revolutionary activities  in  the  countries  of  the  East.  Pending  any  new  decision  all plans  of  revolutionary  activities   in   India  should   be  prepared   in consultation   with   the   Central   Asiatic   Bureau   of   the   Communist International.  Radek  informed  the  Indian  revolutionaries  that  I  was  a member  of  that  Bureau  and  had  just  come  to  Moscow.  He  advised them to get in touch with me and discuss their plans. </p>

      <p>The  meeting  with  Radek  was  even  more  disappointing  than  that  with Lenin.  In  order  to  assuage  the  feelings  of  the  Indian  comrades  Radek promised   to   ask   the   Executive   Committee   of   the   Communist International  to  set  up  a  small  commission  to  hear  the case  of  the Indian  delegation  and  to  investigate  the  whole  situation.  But  that  did not  satisfy  all,  and  soon  thereafter,  most  of  the  members  of  the delegation   left   Moscow,   one   by   one.   Chattopadhyaya,   Agnes Smedley,  Bhupendranath  Dutta,  Luhani,  Nalini  Gupta  and  a  few others stayed behind. </p>

      <p>The Commission to hear the Indian revolutionaries and to examine the Indian  situation  was  composed  of  August  Thalheimer,  the  leader  of the German Communist Party, Tom Queich of the British Communist Party and Borodin. Chatto was  the  obvious  leader  of  the  Indian  delegation.  But  he  was  a  poor speaker,  and  Agnes  Smedley  was  anxious  to  deputise  for  him.  But  a non-Indian  would  not  be  the  right  person  to  open  the  Indian  case, which  was  done  by  Luhani.  He  gave  a  very  good  performance.  After he   had   finished,   Thalheimer   enquired   whether   the   new   Indian comrades  had  any  objection  to  work  in  co-operation  with  me. On enquiry,  I  frankly  said  that  I  would  be  only  too  glad  to  have  the  co-operation  of  the  newcomers.  I  further  added  that  I  did  not  claim  to represent   India.   If   the   new   Indian   comrades   would   agree   on   a programme  of  work,  and  decide  to  stay  in  Moscow  to  take  over  the responsibility  of  guiding  activities,  I  should  place  myself  at  their disposal.  That  brought  Chatto  to  his  feet.  With  great  indignation  he interjected:  “We  have  nothing  against  you,  but  we  cannot  have anything  to  do  with  you  so  long  as  you  are  associated  with  a  known spy who has been responsible for the death of many revolutionaries in India,"  The  Commission  was  taken  aback.  Borodin  suggested  that Comrade  Chatto-padhyaya  should  be  a  little  more  explicit  about  his allegation, if he wanted it to be taken seriously. In any case, who was the  British  spy  he  had  just  mentioned?  Chatto  signalled Luhani  to answer  the  question.  The  accused  was  Abani  Mukherjee, and  the allegation  was  that,  on  his  way  back  to  India  from  Japan  in  1916,  he was  arrested  at  Singapore  and  imprisoned.  He  did  not  escape from prison,  as  he  had  pretended,  -but  was  released  by  the  British  police because   he   had   given   out   information   about   the   underground revolutionary  movement  in  India.  On  his  information,  a  number  of people were arrested in India and sentenced to death and long terms of imprisonment.</p>

      <p>In reply, I informed the Commission under what circumstances I came to  know  Abani  Mukherjee  and  said  that  his  behaviour  had  also  mademe  suspicious;  but  as  long  as  there  was  no  evidence  to  bear  out  the serious  allegation  against  him,  it  would  not  be  fair  to  penalise  him, and the penalty would be the maximum, if I withdrew my protection. I would not take such a responsibility merely on vague suspicions.</p>

      <p>In  order  to  put  an  end  to  the  unpleasant  subject,  which  could  not  be settled there and then, Thalheimer suggested that we should revert to the discussion of any political differences the new  Indian  comrades  might  have  had  with  me.  In  behalf  of  the delegation,  Luhani  replied  that  they  disapproved  of  the  formation  of the Indian Communist Party in Tashkent and demanded its dissolution as  the  condition  for  any  cooperation  with  me.  I  again  explained  the situation  which  was  forced  on  me,  and  pleaded  that  the  Communist Party of India was formed on the initiative of a number of others who would  certainly  not  agree  to  the  dissolution  of  the  party, even  if  I recommended  it.  But  the  Indian  delegation  was  equally  adamant  also on this question. </p>

      <p>Chattopadhyaya, on behalf of the delegation, gave an ultimatum to the Commission.   If   their   demands   were   not   accepted,   they   would forthwith  leave  Moscow,  fully  convinced  that  Indian  revolutionaries could not count on any help there.</p>

      <h3 id="sectionB">B.  The Emigrant Section of the Communist Party of India and the Communist International <a href="#2.2" id="r2.2">*</a></h3>

      <p>The muhajir youths who, on Manabendranath Roy’s inspiration, came to Moscow in different groups, entered the ‘Communist University of the Toiling East’ immediately  on  its  foundation.   The  University  was  founded  on  April  21,  1921. Many of them joined the Communist Party of India after their arrival in Moscow. The emigrant section of the Communist Party of India was granted recognition by  the  Communist  International  in  1921.   There  are  instances  of  Communist Parties, formed with a very few members, becoming affiliated to the Communist International.  The Communist Party of China held its first Congress with only twelve delegates,  representing about fifty members.  The delegate of the Communist International also was present at the Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, affiliated lo it.</p>

      <p>In the Communist Party in India, there were — perhaps there are still now — members who would not believe that the Party was founded abroad.  How could they, therefore, reconcile themselves to the fact of its becoming affiliated to the Communist International.  These members of the Communist Party of India  were  still  under  the  spell  of  nationalism.   It  is  true  that  Sripad  Amrit Dange,  one of the first batch of members to join the Party in the 1920’s,  accepted that the Party was founded abroad; but he too refused to acknowledge that the Party had been affiliated to the Communist International.  He sent this opinion of his in writing to me after the publication of my book The Communist Party of India and Its Formation Abroad.  I am presenting here some facts and proofs regarding the affiliation of the emigrant section of the Communist Party of India to the Communist International in 1921.</p>

      <p>Some  Indian  nationalist  revolutionaries,  led  by  Virendranath  Chattopadhyaya, came from Western Europe to Moscow at the invitation of the Communist International.  They were :
        <ol>
          <li>Virendranath Chattopadhyaya</li>
          <li>Bhupendranath Datta (not a Ph.D. yet)</li>
          <li>Birendranath Dasgupta</li>
          <li>Syed Abdul Wahid</li>
          <li>Prof. Pandurang Sadashiva Khankhoje</li>
          <li>Herambalal Gupta</li>
          <li>Ghulam Ambiya Khan Luhani</li>
          <li>Nalini Gupta</li>
          </ol>
      </p>

      <p>During World War I all except the last-named three had come to an under-standing with imperialist Germany.  It had been agreed that imperialist Ger-many would supply the Indian revolutionaries liberally with arms and moneywith  the  help  of  which  the  Indian  revolutionaries  would  organize  widespreaduprisings in India.  Imperialist Germany helped the Indian revolutionaries withmoney, but I do not know whether this help was liberal or not.  However, it isa fact that Germany could not supply arms.  The Indian revolutionaries were grateful to Germany for helping them with money.  We learn from the autobiography of Raja Mahendra Pratap that the Indian revolutionaries received help from the German Government even after the fall of the Kaiser Government.</p>

      <p>Anyway, the Indian revolutionaries, led by Virendranath Chattopadhyaya,went to Moscow to negotiate with the Communist International. As a nationalist revolutionary,  Chattopadhyay was not in favour of a Communist Party beingformed in India at that time.  What is strange is that Chattopadhyaya himself was then a member of the Anarchist Party.  Before a Commission, appointed by the Communist International, Chattopadhyaya proposed ihat a RevolutionaryBoard  be  set  up  to  carry  on  work  in  India  through  its  agency  and  that  the Communist  Party  —  if  it  is  to  be  formed  at  all  —  be  formed  only  after  the British  had  been  driven  out.   Chattopadhyaya  was  a  well-educated,  erudite person, but, it seems, he was a bad speaker.  He, therefore, submitted what he had  to  say  before  the  Commission  through  Ghulam  Ambiya  Khan  Luhani,  a finished speaker and a good writer.</p>

      <p>It is with a view to making things clear for everybody that I have tried so long to give some preliminary facts.  Now let me state my main point in the words of Dr Bhupendranath Datta:</p>

      <p>“I want to state here that one morning some days ago it appeared suddenly in a Moscow newspaper that an Indian Communist Party had been formed and become affiliated to the Communist International.  Who were the members ofthis  Communist  Party  ?   Roy  with  his  wife,  Mukhopadhyaya  with  his  wife, and  the  muhajir  youths.   Talking  of  this  Party  at  a  meeting  even  before  the Second Commission had begun its sittings, Luhani said, ’It is a bogus party’. Again, while reading their thesis during the second sitting of the Commission, Luhani observed, <i>‘Let the name of this party be struck off the rolls of the Third International’</i> and  that  help  to  the  Indian  revolutionary  movement  be  given through their projected Revolutionary Board.”* (italics mine)</p>

      <p>This  extract  proves  that  the  emigrant  section  of  the  Communist  Party  of India  became  affiliated  to  the  Communist  International  at  that  time.   What should be noted here is that it was Ghulam Ambiya Khan Luhani who presented before a Commission, appointed by the Communist International, the demands of the nationalist revolutionaries who had come from Berlin.</p>

      <p>There is no reference at all to dates in Or Bhupendranath Datta’s writings.However, it can be seen that Dr Datta and his friends came to Moscow early in 1921.  I thank Prof. Khankhoje, for he has at least written that they werein Moscow for three months.  Taking everything into account, we find that they left the Soviet Union even before the commencement of the Third Congress of the Communist International.  The Third Congress started on June 22,  1921, and concluded on July 12, 1921. </p>

      <p>Dr Datta further says that on the question of forming the Communist Party of India, he, Syed Abdul Wahid and Birendranath Dasgupta were not unanimous with Virendranath Chattopadhyaya, the leader of their group.  Dr Datta heldthat the right also to form a Communist Party was exclusively theirs, and they had already written to India in this matter.  Who were these upstart muhajir youths to form the Communist Party of India abroad?  But, even after a lot of investigations inside India, we have not been able to find out who were the persons  to  whom  Dr  Datta  here  wrote  letters  with  the  purpose  of  forming  a Communist  Party.   About  this,  neither  did  he  say  anything  to  us  nor  did  he write anything in his book.  Dr Datta returned lo India in 1925 and died in 1961:  he had time enough.</p>

      <p>Agnes Smedley was an American woman and a friend of India.  She also held anarchist views.  She married Virendranath Chattopadhyaya.  It is not necessary to give any account of Nalini Gupta here.  I shall discuss him in detail later.</p>

      <h3 id="sectionBpartII">II</h3>

          <p>The emigrant section of the Indian Communist Party extended its activites
      to Germany, where the first organ of the Party was brought out on May 15,
      1922. Its name was the Vanguard of the Indian Independence. Needless to say,
      this first fortnightly organ of our Party was published in English language. The
      paper was edited mainly by Manabendranath Roy and his first wife, Evelan
      Trent Roy sometimes contributed articles to Indian journals under the pen-
      name of Shanti Devi. Packets of the Vanguard of the Indian Independence were
      received at different addresses supplied by us, and we distributed them among
      different persons. We would also put copies of the paper into the letter-boxes
      at certain addresses in Calcutta. Further, only individual copies were sent to
      certain addresses. This was a comparatively safe method to ensure delivery.
      The paper did not bear the declaration the it was the organ of the Communist
      Party of India, a branch of the Communist International. When we realized
      that the police had become very much aware of the existence of the Vanguard
      of the Indian Independence and had also started seizing packets bearing certain
      addresses, I wrote to Manabendranath Roy, “Now it is time to change the
      name of the paper. It may make things a bit easier.” I do not know whether
      anyone else from any other province made the same suggestion, but Roy wrote
      in reply that he would change the name of the paper. Thereafter, the paper
      was named the Advance Guard. The Advance Guard also did not carry any
      declaration that it was the organ of the Communist Party of India, a branch
      of the Communist International. But we found some time later that, like its
      predecessor, the Advance Guard also had roused the suspicion of the police. It
      was then decided to revive the former name of the paper, but it was discovered
      that Dr Datta and others, i.e. the nationalist revolutionaries who had returned
      to Germany from Moscow had in the mean-time taken possession of a half of the
      former name and had themselves brought out one named Indian Independence
      with Prof. Binoy Kumar Sarkar as editor.</p>

          <p>The Vanguard of the Indian Indepenence and the Advance Guard between
      them covered a period of one year. The first issue of the second year appeared
      on May 15, 1923, as simply the Vanguard. There was no hide-and-seek affair
      this time. In clear language it was stated that the Vanguard was the organ
      of the Communist Party of India, a section of the Communist International.
      Lest anyone should entertain any doubt about this, I am reproducing here the
      block made from the photostat of the first issue of the second year (May 15,
      1923) of the Vanguard. The message, sent by the Presidium of the Communist
      International to the Vanguard on its first anniversary, was also printed on the first page of the issue. Can there be any evidence more incontrovertible even
      than this?</p>

          <p>I had not seen this issue or the subsequent issues of the Vanguard previously,
      for I was arrested and imprisoned on May 17, 1923. But Sripad Amrit Dange
      and Sachchidananda Vishnu Ghate were then free, and they saw and read this
      issue of the Vanguard of May 15, 1923, and the subsequent issues. Dange was
      not arrested before March, 1924. After Dange’ s arrest, i. e. from 1924, Ghate
      became active in the Party. Yet both supplied wrong information on the basis
      of which the Right Communists of India observed the fortieth anniversary of
      the Party in 1966. They have taken 1925 — the year of the Kanpur Communist
      Conference — as the year of the foundation of the Party.</p>

        <p>Although the Vanguard and other papers had from the beginning been
      printed in Germany, the names of different cities of India also appeared in
      the paper. The names of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras appear in the block
      printed here. There is no doubt that the name of Lahore was usually printed in
      the paper. As far as I can remember, the name of Kanpur also appeared some
      time or other. We had contacts more or less with all these cities.</p>

      <h3 id="sectionBpartIII">III</h3>

            <p>The historic Seventh Plenum of the Communist International was held in
      Moscow from November 22 to December 12, 1926. The stenographic report in
      Russian of this Plenum was published in two volumes in Russia. The report
      is entitled in Russian Puti Mirovoi revoliutsii (Paths of World Revolution).
      Drawing upon the account given on p. 8 of vol. I of World Revolution, Robert
      C. North and Xenia have written in the book, edited by them, Af. N. Roy’s
      Mission to China: Communist- Kuomintang Split of 1927 :</p>

          <p>"<em>During the first session of the Seventh Plenum, November 22, 1926, Roy
      as the representative of the Communist Party of India had been elected to the
      Presidium of the Comintern and to the Chinese Commission.</em>" (p. 43)</p>

      <p>It is written in quite clear language that it was as the representative of
      the Communist Party of India that Roy was elected to the Presidium of the
      Communist International and to the Chinese Commission. This Party was the
      Communist Party of India founded abroad. No application for affiliation of the
      Communist Party was sent from within India to the office of the Communist
      International in 1926.</p>

      <h3 id="sectionBpartIV">IV</h3>

          <p>On November 30, 1927, M. N. Roy wrote a long letter on behalf of the Communist International to the Central Committees of both the Communist Party
      of India and the Workers’ and Peasants’ Party. The letter became known in
      India as ‘Assembly Letter’. It was stated in the letter that every Communist
      Party must become affiliated to the Communist International. But from India
      no application for affiliation to the Comintern was ever sent by the Communist Party. In fact, “Up till now Communist International has acted upon the affiliation of the Emigrant Section of the Communist Party of India.”</p>

        <p>It is now proved that the Communist Party ,of India was established on
      October 17, 1920,. in the city of Tashkent, capital of the present Republic of
      Uzbekistan.</p>

      <p>It is also proved beyond dispute that the emigrant section of the Communist
      Party of India was affiliated to the Communist International.</p>

      <p>In his Memoirs M. N. Roy writes : “To challenge my representativeness was
      pointless. I did not claim to represent anybody but myself, and held my position
      in the International as an individual (p. 301)”. The facts I have presented in
      the foregoing pages, the extracts I have reproduced from the book M. N. Roy’s
      Mission to China and Roy’s letter— all taken together — go to prove that
      Roy’s pretension was entirely false. He had represented the Mexican Communist
      Party in the Second Congress of the Communist International. Thereafter, he
      had always represented the emigrant section of the Communist Party of India.
      None but representatives of the Communist Parties of different countries could
      hold any office in the Communist International. M. N. Roy was elected to the
      Presidium of the Communist International as representative of the Communist
      Party of India in the same way as Stalin, Bukharin and Manuilsky were elected
      to the Presidium as representatives of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
      Even Lenin had he been alive then, would have had to get elected in the same
      way.</p>

      <br/>
      <h4>Who are The Founder-members of the Party?</h4>

      <p>I hope that I have been able to clarify a number of points for future writers
      of the history of the Communist Party of India. Now that these points are
      clarified, those of us who are called the founder-members of the Communist
      Party of India can no longer find, I believe, much strength behind that claim
      of ours. The real founder-members of the Communist Party of India are those
      who joined the Party in Tashkent and Moscow in 1920-21. We can never forget
      the fact that the Communist International granted affiliation to the emigrant
      section of the Communist Party of India in 1921. Some of the members of the
      emigrant section of the Party went through great sufferings and hardships in
      order to return to India and, even after undergoing imprisonment here, did not
      give up serving the Party. It was with us that they worked. We could have, if
      we wanted, regarded our Party as an affiliate of the Communist International,
      but the idea did not occur to us at that time.</p>

      <p>Towards the close of 1921, we also began to move to some extent. We
      became quite active in 1922. Prison life also began for us in 1923. Everybody
      knows that prison life was inevitable for the revolutionary workers of India.
      But notwithstanding all this, can we claim to be the founder-members of the
      Communist Party of India? As for myself, I cannot find much conviction to
      make this claim; we can, however, claim, that we only paved the way to the
      building of the Party.</p>

      <h4>A few words about Muhammad Shafiq</h4>

      <p>I have already said that Muhammad Shafiq was elected the first Secretary of
      the emigrant section of the Communist Party of India and was — by virtue
      of his position — the first Secretary of the Communist Party of India, for no
      Communist Party had been formed in India in 1920-21. Everyone will naturally
      ask who this Muhammad Shafiq was. If I want to say anything about him,
      however insignificant, I shall have to depend on secret police reports and the
      reports of the proceedings at the court of law. I never knew Shafiq personally.
      My account, therefore, is based mainly on the material I have collected from
      police reports and court documents.</p>

      <p>Muhammad Shafiq was a resident of Akora in the tehsil Nowshera of Peshawar. In 1919, he served as a clerk in the irrigation office at Peshawar. In
      his judgment, delivered on April 4, 1924, in the case against Shafiq, Mr George
      Connor, Sessions Judge of Peshawar, observed that during the anti Rowlatt Act
      movement Shafiq went to Kabul in May, 1919, without giving any notice to his
      office. Again it was in May, 1919, that Afghanistan attacked British India; and
      as a result of this war (the Third Afghan War) Afghanistan won the status of
      a fully independent state. Shafiq must have gone to Kabul as a muhajir (self-exiled), but it should be remembered that he did not belong to the muhajirs of
      1920. The Hijrat (flight from persecution) movement was yet to start when he
      left India. The Hijrat movement of 1920 originated from the Khilafat agitation
      and only the Muslims participated in it - but the movement against the Rowlatt
      Act was a broad-based political one, cutting across the barriers of nationality
      and religion. The tragic incidents, which took place in Jalianwalla Bagh in Am-
      ritsar on April 13. 1919, arose from the anti-Rowlatt Act movement, which the
      British Government in India wanted to suppress ruthlessly.</p>

      <p>In course of his judgment the Sessions Judge observed, “His intention in
      going there (Kabul) was soon made apparent for he at once got into touch with
      Bolshevik agents who were then at Kabul.” If the Judge’s observation is correct,
      then Shafiq, possibly, got into touch with the Bolsheviks before reaching Kabul.</p>

      <p>On December 10, 1923-after his arrest-Shafiq made a statement before Khan
      Muhammad, Additional Magistrate of Peshawar. To make a statement like this
      before a Magistrate IS a sign of great weakness; but Shafiq made it. A man
      making such a statement is never entirely truthful; on the he fabricates a lot of
      things. Therefore, to get at the truth one has to read the statement between the
      lines. Shafiq says that it was in Kabul he met Raja Mahendra Pratap, Abdur
      Rab and Acharya: they had just returned from Russia. To the muhajirs who
      were in Kabul at the time, either Abdur Rab or both Rab and Acharya said
      that the Russian Government looked upon the Indian muhajirs with respect
      and also helped them. As soon as Shafiq heard this, he started for Russia
      via Mazar-i-Sharif. He was accompanied by Ahmad Hassan, and Abdul Majid
      and Muhammad Sadiq of Kohat. Ahmad Hassan was probably Muhammad
      Ali alias Khushi Muhammad. Shafiq’s statement points to the existence of
      factionalism among the Indian muhajirs in Kabul. Shafiq belonged to Moulana
      Obeidullah Sindhi’s group. At the time of his departure for Russia, he had seen
      Abdur Rab having a quarrel with Moulana Obeidullah over extremely petty
      personal interests. The subsequent activites of Abdur Rab showed him to be
      a cantankerous and factious short of person. Shafiq and the others reached
      Tashkent safely. It seems that they reached Tashkent some time towards the
      end of 1919. As it was not possible to stay idle there, they brought out a
      paper named Zamindar in Urdu and Persian. In the Punjab and the North-
      Western Frontier Province Zamindar means ‘peasant’. Only one issue of the
      paper came out. When making his statement before the Magistrate, Shafiq,
      probably, thought that the single issue of Zamindar had not certainly reached
      India. He, therefore, said that it was on the ideals of Islam that the paper
      had been based. The issue of Zamindar was not just another exhibit in the
      case; it was exhibit No. 2. The judgment contained many extracts from the
      issue, but there was no evidence of anything Islamic in them. Shafiq, perhaps,
      spoke of the Islamic basis of the paper in order to minimize his offence. Some
      three months (three, according to Shafiq’s estimate, which, however, does not
      tally with my calculation) after Shafiq’ s arrival in Tashkent, Abdur Rab and
      Prativadi Acharya came there with a party of thirty muhajirs. The mass Hijrat
      movement of 1920 had already started in India.
      </p>

      <p>Some days later Shafiq received the invitation to attend the Second Congress
      of the Communist International, which was to be held from July 19 to August
      7, 1920, With the purpose of minimizing his offence, Shafiq told the Judge that
      they had gone to Moscow under orders from the Soviet Government. Faction-
      alism had already started in Tashkent also. Shafiq states, ”Acharya went to
      Moscow for the Second Congress on behalf of the revolutionary committee of
      Abdur Rab, and I went on behalf of our group”. The expression ‘our group’,
      perhaps, means the group opposed to Abdur Rab. It was in Moscow that Shafiq
      first made the acquaintance of Manabendranath Roy and Abani Mukherjee, Roy,
      Mukherjee and Acharya attended the Congress as delegates; Shafiq had an ob-
      server’s ticket. It is difficult for me to say whether Shafiq was really an observer
      or told the story of the observer’s ticket in order to minimize his offence.</p>


      <p>However, Roy alone had the right both to participate in the deliberations
      and to vote. The other Indians could only participate in the deliberations.</p>

      <p>One thing, however, strikes me as very strange. Why did Manabendranath
      make no reference to Prativadi Acharya and Shafiq in his Memoirs! How could
      Roy forget that both Prativadi Acharya and Muhammad Shafiq had attended
      the Second Congress of the Communist International? I cannot believe that any
      revolutionary could ever forget an incident like this in his career. Roy writes
      that it must have been a very strange thing that he should represent Mexico and
      Abani Mukherjee should represent India (although without the voting right) in
      the Second Congress of the Comintern. The names of Prativadi Acharya and
      ’Shafiq should have been specially mentioned; but Roy did not mention them.</p>

      <p>When the question arose of sending back home the young Indian muhajir
      students of the Communist University of the Toiling East, attempts were made
      to procure by various means passport for them. Those who failed to procure
      passports for themselves reached India across the nearly impassable and insur-
      mountable Pamir and the Hindu Kush. From the documents of the Moscow Conspiracy Case in Peshawar it appears that Shafiq Muhammad was very lucky
      in the matter of passport. What we had so long referred to as the Peshawar
      Conspiracy Case (1922-23) is now found to have been described as the Moscow
      Conspiracy Case in the relevant records. With the help of a false British pass-
      port procured for him, Shafiq returned to India by sea from a certain port in
      Holland. Fida All Zahid, an approver in the Moscow Conspiracy Case, said
      that he had heard from the Russian instructor in the Military Academy that
      from Europe Shafiq went to Lahore but then for fear of being arrested he fled to
      Kabul in panic. Abdulla Qadir Sehrai(Khan) said that Shafiz had visited India
      secretly several times. He said further that with the help of a false British pass-
      port Shafiq had returned to India by sea from a port in Holland in November,
      1921, but he had gone to Kabul, fearing arrest.</p>

      <p>It seems that the latter is the correct information. In a letter sent from
      Kabul to M. N. Roy on August 29, 1922, there is a reference to one ‘S’. This ‘S’
      probably is Shafiq. The author of this letter said that ‘S’ was trying to deliver
      him up in the hands of A.G. (the Afghan Government). Was Muhammad Ali
      the author of the letter? If all this be true, then it must be admitted that Shafiq
      had degenerated.</p>

      <p>What followed was that towards the end of 1922, when the Afghan Government asked the Indian revolutionaries to leave Afghanistan, Shafiq also had to
      leave with them. Many of the Indian revolutionaries went to Moscow, but Shafiq
      no longer had the face to go there. He went to Seestan, where he gave himself
      up to the British Consul, praying to be sent to India. I cannot understand why
      Shafiq went to Seestan to surrender. Seestan today is not a big province; a
      third of it is in Iran, the rest in Afghanistan. Shafiq, however, was arrested as
      soon as he reached the Indian border, and proceedings (the Second Communist
      Conspiracy Case) were started against him under sec. 121-A of the Indian Penal
      Code. George Connor, Sessions Judge of Peshawar, sentenced Shafiq to three
      years’ rigorous imprisonment on April 4, 1924.</p>

      <p>I shall have to write about Muhammad Shafiq once again in connection with
      Shaukat Usmani.</p>
